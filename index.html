								<h2>Skim through the essay prompt<br /></h2>
								<p>Slowly, go over the question, word by word. Let it sink in. This will make you feel prodcutive, and that's what counts. So that's enough for the day.</p>

								<h2>Review<br /></h2>
								<p> If there's an unlikely chance that you have some energy left, read over your writing and fix whatever sounds meh. If not, you can always ask your buddy to read for you while you relax. Pro tip: to catch non-contextual mistakes like spelling, read your essay backwards. That way, your mind focuses on the words themselves instead of the meaning.</p>
